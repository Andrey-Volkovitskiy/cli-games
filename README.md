# Brain Games

**This is the 1st training project of the Hexlet "Python Developer" course.**

It consists of a set of six simple games:
- Brain-games: user greeting
- Brain-even: try to guess if the number is even or odd
- Brain-calc: try to calculate a simple math expression (a + b = ?)
- Brain-gcd: try to guess the greatest common divisor for a given number
- Brain-progression: try to guess the missing number in progression (7, 9, 11, .., 15)
- Brain-prime: try to guess if the number is prime or not
